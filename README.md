# Self-Assesment

WOW! I did it. I'm not the most electric gadget inclined person out there, I still believe the best way to learn math is to write it out, but I did this. As a young student I was always stronger in math and anything that had to do with numbers, yet when it came to choose a major I chose the Social Sciences. In the real world this major didn't provide the oppotunities I would've liked for myself and noticed from job descriptions that most asked for some technical skill, other than just data entry. I had been thinking of taking online coding classs for sometime and finally conviced myself with this course.

I do not regret this decision, I've learned so much from the beginning of the course to the very end. Things and programs I didn't know existed outside the Microsoft suite and how to power on and off my computer. Every week presented a new challenge I was happy to take it on. It was difficult to continue with my full time job and the class but I hope to have learned the skills that will make me a more marketable candidate in my upcoming job search. My favorite topics were Python, and I intend to continue learning in this. I liked being able to make a web page with html and flask, learning about sql, something that I only knew because it would come up in work conversations some times. Big data was mind blowing and machine learning a little difficult to understand but I hope to figure it out one day as I continue with my education.

I've come a long way, but this is a little of what I wanted it. Something that could hook my interest and where I can continue to build. I feel this course has set a strong foundation and I can continue building from here. At least there is a little more guidance and direction as I move forward to areas I'd like to expand to. 

# Team Assesment

My team, what an amazing group of driven and intelligent women who were very motivating in this final leg of the course. My team consisted of myself, Corinee, Elaine, and Manupriya, and I'm very thankful to have been able to work with them. We met about 4 to 5 times a week, we communicated well with each other and the girls were super patient when I didn't understand sometimes requirements that were asked of me. In our meetings we would try to debug issues as needed and set expected milestones to meet by nest meeting. Very well organized women, I see great things coming from them.  

# Summary of Project

Our project was an analysis of reviews from e-commerce business, Olist. We tried using machine learning to figure out what customers were suggesting were better services the company can improve. From the information derived most of it had to do with it's package delivery service and suggestions were made to make this service better.
